CONFIGURATION RELATED
----------------------

In the configuration files, databases identifiers must start with database and begin with "database1".


KNOWN ISSUES
------------

1) With more than two replicas, the current implementation does not always tolerate the simultaneous crash of two or more replicas. This is because only the first active (non-crashed) member of the group broadcasts a reconfiguration message. For instance with 3 replicas, if the primary and the first backup crash at the same time, no replica will broadcast a new configuration. This would not be hard to fix however.
