 * This file is part of ShadowDB - a replicated database based on
 * an formally-verified implementation of an atomic broadcast service.
 * The normal case processing is written in Java, while failure-handling is taken
 * care of by an atomic broadcast service called Aneris. Aneris contains
 * two formally-verified implementations of atomic broadcast, one is
 * based on Paxos, the other one is based on two-third consensus.
 * 
 * The three code contributors of this project are:
 * Vincent Rahli (Aneris)
 * Nicolas Schiper (ShadowDB)
 * Mark Bickford (Aneris)
 * 
 * ShadowDB was implemented at Cornell University, Ithaca, NY.
